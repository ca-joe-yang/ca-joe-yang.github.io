title: "Soft Ranking Threshold Losses For Image Retrieval"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/softranking
excerpt: 'This paper proposes a novel loss, soft ranking threshold loss, for driving deep networks to learn better representations for image retrieval. Instead of working in the metric space, our loss works in the rank space which has a more uniform distribution and explicit scale and bounds. Our loss reduces the ranks of the distances between anchor-positive pairs below the threshold while increasing the ones between anchor-negative pairs above the threshold. In addition to the basic form, two extensions are proposed for improving the effectiveness: hard thresholds and ranking margin. Experiments show that the proposed loss outperforms the state-of-the-art losses on image retrieval applications.'
